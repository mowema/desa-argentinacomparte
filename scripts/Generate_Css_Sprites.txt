Css and javascript will be minified with yuicompressor located in tools.
Images are being trated as sprites, using fondue located in tools, also it is possible to make the sprites in
http://spritegen.website-performance.org/
NOTE: when you get the css, the rules are missing the url to the sprite itself so you have to add it yourself.

When ever you add a new image file in public/images folder if you plan to make a sprite of it, you MUST copy 
it to tools/images-for-sprite-generation

put it a name and increment the prefix number

you MUST also use the smushit yahoo's service once you get the image, it will take at least 20k from the image
